# Money Manager

A personal expense management application built with Next.js that handles both accounts and credit cards with split functionality.

## Why I Built This

I've tried different expense management apps/websites including Fold Money, Cred Money, Money Manager, Dime, etc., but never found an app that properly takes care of both accounts and split functionality. I found a few that handle accounts but not credit cards, which was so frustrating.

So I built my own solution that addresses these pain points.

## Features

- **Add transactions with split functionality** - Choose between account or credit card
- **Manage categories** - Organize your expenses efficiently
- **Manage connections** - For splitting expenses among people
- **Manage sources** - Bank accounts, credit cards, cash

## Upcoming Features

- Import/Export functionality
- Split among friends
- Auto-fetch transactions from email

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
